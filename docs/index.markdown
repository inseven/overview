Overview is a minimal app that gives you an at-a-glance overview of how you spend your time each month by grouping like-named calendar entries.

Select one or more calendars to quickly identify tasks that are taking up too much time, and ones might need a little more love.

Combined with all-day calendar entries that record where you are, and work or non-work days, Overview can be a great way to report on how you spend your time for multi-region tax reporting.
